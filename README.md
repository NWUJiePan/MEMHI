# Experimental Results' directory
Concerning the parameter settings of the comparison methods, it is explicitly mentioned that we adopt the parameter values recommended in their original works for each method. The performance of these comparison methods is then evaluated under the same 5-fold cross-validation setup as MEMHI to ensure consistency and avoid potential biases in the experimental scenarios. Furthermore, in our project's repository on GitHub, we not only furnish a comprehensive description of the parameter settings for each comparison method but also upload all experimental results. This is aimed at facilitating the reproducibility of our work and providing transparency in the evaluation process.
